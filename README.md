# Vector Dot Product  
## C++ Implementation  

The **vector dot product** is a fundamental operation in linear algebra used to compute the scalar product of two vectors. It is determined by summing the products of their corresponding components.  

### Key Features  
1. **Mathematical Definition**:  
   The dot product of two vectors $$\( \mathbf{a} \)$$  and  $$\( \mathbf{b} \)$$ is defined as:  
   $$\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i b_i$$  
   Here, $$\( a_i \)$$ and $$\( b_i \)$$ represent the $$\(i\)-th$$ components of vectors $$\( \mathbf{a} \)$$ and $$\( \mathbf{b} \),$$ respectively.  

2. **Result**:  
   The operation results in a **scalar value**.  

3. **Applications**:  
   - **Angle Measurement**: Determines the cosine of the angle between the vectors.  
   - **Projections**: Projects one vector onto another.  
   - **Orthogonality Check**: A dot product of zero indicates the vectors are perpendicular.

### Geometric Interpretation  

The **dot product** can also be represented geometrically:  
```
u ⋅ v = ||u|| ||v|| cos(θ)
```

Here:  
- `||u||` and `||v||` are the magnitudes of vectors `u` and `v`, respectively.  
- `θ` is the angle between the vectors.  

#### Insights:  
- If `cos(θ) > 0`: The angle is acute (`θ < 90°`).  
- If `cos(θ) < 0`: The angle is obtuse (`θ > 90°`).  
- If `cos(θ) = 0`: The vectors are orthogonal.

## Alerts
> [!Warning]
> The dot product will be negative if the vectors are pointing in opposite directions.
> [Note]
> This can happen if the angle between the vectors exceeds 90 degrees.

The following table shows examples of two vectors and their corresponding dot products.

| Vector A          | Vector B          | Dot Product (A . B)                                  |
|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| (1, 2, 3)         | (4, -5, 6)        | (1 * 4) + (2 * -5) + (3 * 6) = 4 - 10 + 18 = 12     |
| (2, 3, 4)         | (5, 6, 7)         | (2 * 5) + (3 * 6) + (4 * 7) = 10 + 18 + 28 = 56     |
| (-1, 0, 1)        | (0, 1, -1)        | (-1 * 0) + (0 * 1) + (1 * -1) = 0 + 0 - 1 = -1      |

# Footnotes example
### Explanation of the Dot Product
kk
The **dot product** of two vectors is often used to calculate the **projection** of one vector onto another[^1].

- If the dot product is **positive**, the angle between the vectors is acute.
- If the dot product is **negative**, the angle is obtuse[^2].

[^1]: The dot product projection is a measure of how much one vector extends in the direction of another.
[^2]: A negative dot product indicates that the vectors are pointing in opposite directions.
